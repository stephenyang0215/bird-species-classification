**MLOps end-to-end demo on GCP.**<br />
<br />
It's a short presentation on the data apps(streamlit) using bird species classification to easily identify the photo urls you take. <br />
The image dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species which consists of 475 classes, so you can try many types of bird species to see how it perform.<br />
With Cloud Build we commit the new version then directly deployed it on GKE.
