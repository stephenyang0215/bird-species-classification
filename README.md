## bird-species-classification
#MLOps end-to-end demo on GCP.
It's a short presentation on the data apps(streamlit) using bird species classification to easily identify the photo urls you take.
The image dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species which consists of 475 classes, so you can try many types of bird species to see how it perform.
With Cloud Build we commit the new version then directly deployed it on GKE.
